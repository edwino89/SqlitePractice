# SQLITE AS A GRAPH DATABASE
Idea is to use sqlite like Neo4J; 
* Nodes and edges
* CRUD, Filter, Aggregate, Views... 

### SQLITE COMMANDS
* Import SQL into 
```
sqlite3 path/to/db < path/to/file.sql
```
* Format query outputs 
```
.mode markdown
```

## CREATE TABLES
```
CREATE 
TABLE nodes (
id integer primary key autoincrement,
data text);
```

```
CREATE 
TABLE edges(
id integer unique,
previous_node integer,
next_node integer,
foreign key(previous_node) references nodes(id),
foreign key(next_node) references nodes(id),
primary key(previous_node, next_node, id));
```


## INSERT DATA
Sqlite does not auto increment non primary key fields
Edges can have loops
So no top down manenos

```
-- Nodes
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Bob');
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Hank');
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Jeff');
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Sally');
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Sue');
INSERT INTO nodes (data) VALUES ('Sam');
-- Edges
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (1, 1, 2);
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (2, 1, 3);
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (3, 2, 4);
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (4, 3, 4);
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (5, 4, 5);
-- Edges with Loops 
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (98, 3, 1);
INSERT INTO edges (id, previous_node, next_node) VALUES (99, 5, 1);

```
